Feature: Managing system adapts sensor sampling rate in response to reliability changes

# 	Scenario: Check if /enactor communicates with /reli_engine and /logger
# 		Given the /enactor node is online
# 		When I check if topics /strategy are inbound and /exception are outbound to /reli_engine
# 		And I check if topics /event are inbound and /log_adapt are outbound to /logger
# 		Then /enactor node is connected appropriately

  @topology @regression
  Scenario: The adaptation enactor exchanges adaptation strategies with the reliability engine
    Given the adaptation enactor is running
    Then the adaptation enactor should subscribe to "adaptation strategy" published by the reliability engine
    And the adaptation enactor should publish "adaptation exception" to the reliability engine
  
  
  @topology @regression
  Scenario: The adaptation enactor exchanges adaptation records with the system log
    Given the adaptation enactor is running
    Then the adaptation enactor should subscribe to "log event" published by the system log
    And the adaptation enactor should publish "adaptation log" to the system log


# 	Scenario: Check if /logger communicates with /collector, /param_adapter, /enactor, /data_access, /injector
# 		Given the /logger node is online
# 		When I check if topics /log_uncertainty are inbound from /injector
# 		And I check if topics /log_adapt are inbound and /event are outbound to /enactor
# 		And I check if topics /log_event,/log_status,/log_energy_status are inbound from /collector
# 		And I check if topics /reconfigure are outbound to /param_adapter
# 		And I check if topics /persist are outbound to /data_access
# 		Then /logger node is connected appropriately

  @topology
  Scenario Outline: The system log receives each topic collected by the log collector
    Given the system log is running
    Then the system log should subscribe to <topic> published by the log collector

    Examples:
      | topic                |
      | sensor event         |
      | sensor status        |
      | sensor energy status |

  # Sem @regression: mudou a ROTA, nao o resultado final. No ROS1 o
  # Logger.cpp publicava "reconfigure" para o param_adapter; aqui a
  # reconfiguracao chega por outro caminho - EffectorRegister +
  # reconfigure_<node> por componente (param_adapter.py:37-66) - ja validado
  # passando por target_system.feature e confirmado entregando de fato. Segue
  # xfail so porque nada ORIGINA pedidos hoje - falta o /enactor. Ver
  # MANAGING_SYSTEM_GAPS.md.
  Scenario: The system log sends reconfiguration requests to the parameter adapter
    Given the system log is running
    Then the system log should publish "reconfiguration request" to the parameter adapter

# # Novos cenarios
#   Scenario: Sampling rate increases when sensor reliability falls below the threshold (G4/G5)
#     Given the managing system is monitoring the reliability of sensor /g3t1_1
#     When sensor /g3t1_1 repeatedly reports a 'fail' status
#     Then an adaptation command increasing the sampling rate of sensor /g3t1_1 should be issued

  Scenario: Sampling rate increases when sensor reliability falls below the threshold (G4/G5)
    Given the managing system is monitoring the reliability of the oximeter
    When the oximeter repeatedly reports a 'fail' status
    Then an adaptation command increasing the sampling rate of the oximeter should be issued


#   Scenario: Sampling rate decreases after sensor reliability recovers (G4/G5)
#     Given sensor /g3t1_1 is operating at an elevated sampling rate after a prior adaptation
#     When the sensor reliability rises above the configured threshold
#     Then an adaptation command reducing the sampling rate of sensor /g3t1_1 should be issued

  @behavior @g4-g5 @regression
  Scenario: Sampling rate decreases after sensor reliability recovers (G4/G5)
    Given the oximeter is operating at an elevated sampling rate
    When the reliability of the oximeter rises above the threshold
    Then an adaptation command reducing the sampling rate of the oximeter should be issued


#   Scenario: A failed adaptation attempt is recorded in the system log (G4/G5)
#     Given an adaptation command has been issued for sensor /g3t1_1
#     When the adaptation cannot be delivered to the sensor
#     Then a failure record for sensor /g3t1_1 should be available in the system log within 2 seconds

  # Bloqueado em duas camadas. A regressao (nada emite nem loga comandos de
  # adaptacao aqui) e a que se ve primeiro; embaixo dela ha um gap que
  # NENHUMA das duas versoes atende: nao existe registro especifico de
  # "falha". O Controller.cpp do ROS1 publica o AdaptationCommand
  # incondicionalmente ao calcular a nova frequencia - sem ack, sem
  # confirmacao de entrega, sem branch de falha - e o Logger persiste todos
  # sob um unico type. O proprio teste ROS1 deste cenario so checa se
  # /logger e /data_access estao online e dorme 2s. Ou seja: mesmo depois de
  # mergear o subsistema de adaptacao, este cenario continua falhando ate
  # alguem decidir entre construir deteccao de falha ou reescrever o cenario
  # para o que o sistema faz de fato. Ver MANAGING_SYSTEM_GAPS.md, nota #7.
  Scenario: A failed adaptation attempt is recorded in the system log (G4/G5)
    Given the oximeter cannot receive adaptation commands
    When an adaptation command is issued for the oximeter
    Then a failure record identifying the oximeter should be available in the system log


#   Scenario: Managing system responds to reliability degradation within acceptable time (G4/G5)
#     Given sensor /g3t1_1 is operating normally with stable reliability
#     When sensor /g3t1_1 repeatedly reports a 'fail' status
#     Then an adaptation command for sensor /g3t1_1 should be issued within 10 seconds

  @timing @g4-g5 @regression
  Scenario: An adaptation command is issued within 10 seconds after reliability degradation (G4/G5)
    Given the oximeter is operating normally with stable reliability
    When the oximeter repeatedly reports a 'fail' status
    Then an adaptation command for the oximeter should be issued within 10 seconds


#   @xfail
#   Scenario: No adaptation is triggered when reliability is within the acceptable range (G4/G5)
#     Given the /reli_engine node is computing reliability within the acceptable range
#     And the /enactor node is active
#     When the managing system evaluates the current reliability state
#     Then the /reli_engine should not publish a new strategy to /strategy
#     And the /enactor should not issue any adaptation command to log_adapt

  @xfail @behavior @g4-g5
  # Razão técnica:
  # O controlador SA-BSN opera como otimizador contínuo (kp=150, bounds=[0.1, 40] Hz,
  # stability_margin=0.02). Com r_curr = 1.0 ele emite comandos de redução contínua em vez
  # de permanecer em silêncio; a propriedade "sem adaptação" não é satisfeita pela
  # implementação legada. Mantido deliberadamente: se passar em ROS 2, o comportamento
  # do controlador mudou e isso precisa aparecer no relatório de migração.
  Scenario: No adaptation is triggered while sensor reliability stays above the threshold (G4/G5)
    Given the managing system is monitoring the reliability of the oximeter
    When the reliability of the oximeter stays above the threshold
    Then no adaptation command for the oximeter should be issued
