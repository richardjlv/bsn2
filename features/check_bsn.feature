	# Rastreabilidade BDD03: BSN-C01. Complementar; relação parcial com P7; título histórico P08.
	Scenario Outline: The central hub receives the vital sign reading reported by a body sensor (BSN-P08)
		Given the patient is being monitored by <sensor>
		When <sensor> reports a new vital sign reading
		Then the central hub should receive that reading with the value reported by <sensor>
		
		Examples:
			| sensor          |
			| the oximeter    |
			| the ECG sensor  |
			| the thermometer |
			| the SBP sensor  |
			| the DBP sensor  |
			| the glucometer  |

	# Rastreabilidade BDD04: BSN-P09. Recorte alto de P9; referência recuperada do histórico.
	Scenario: The central hub classifies a vital sign reading outside the normal range as high risk (BSN-P08)
		Given the patient is being monitored by the oximeter
		When the oximeter reports a blood oxygenation reading outside its normal range
		Then the central hub should classify the patient risk for blood oxygenation as high

	# Rastreabilidade BDD05: BSN-C02. Variante local de indisponibilidade, relacionada a P7/P9.
	Scenario: No patient risk level is reported while the central hub is unavailable (BSN-P08)
		Given the central hub is unavailable
		When the oximeter reports a new vital sign reading
		Then no patient risk level should be reported for that reading
